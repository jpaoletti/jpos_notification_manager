This module is intended to do general notifications based on jPOS Loggin system.
There is a bean definition that must be located in some deploy folder with the
following definition.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<notificator class="org.jpos.ee.notification.core.NotificationQBean" logger="Q2">
    <property name="logger"         value="notifications" />
    <property name="realm"             value="some-realm" />
    <property name="notification"     value="cfg/notifications/test.xml" />
    <!-- <property name="notification"     value="...." /> -->
</notificator>

[logger]         is the name of the logger where the notifications will be posted. 
[realm]         is the realm used by the logger.
[notification]     are one (or more) xml files that defines notifications.


Each notification file is an xml that must specify a sublcass of Notification 
abstract class. The general parameters are:
[localname]     Descriptive name of the notification
[delay]         Interval (in milliseconds) for notification excecution.
[script]     A notification subclass-dependant script to obtain notification data
[properties] Extra properties for the specific subclass

The test.xml file is an example of SQLNotification and looks like

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<notification class="org.jpos.ee.notification.core.SQLNotification">
    <localname>Date Time Test</localname>
    <delay>20000</delay>
    <script>
        SELECT date(current_timestamp) as Date , time(current_timestamp) as Time
    </script>
    <properties>
        <property name="column-separator" value="  $  " />
    </properties>
</notification>

The output of the test.xml notification is

<log realm="" at="Fri Mar 19 15:22:40 ART 2010.385" lifespan="50ms">
    <trace>
        2010-03-19  $  15:22:40  $  
    </trace>
</log>

The joke of this module is to integrate it with the log listener
org.jpos.util.OperatorLogListener class (included in mail optional 
module). So if someone need an email notification of the status of
some data base data, is as simple as configure a logger with an
OperatorLogListener pointing and email address, configure the
Notification Manager to point this logger and build the notification
file.
